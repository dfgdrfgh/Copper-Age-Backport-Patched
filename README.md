## Features

### Copper Golem Entity
- **Natural spawning**: Place a carved pumpkin on a copper block to summon your golem
- **Oxidation system**: Copper golems age through four stages (normal, exposed, weathered, oxidized)
- **Item interactions**: Give items to your golem - they'll store them in their chest and show them off
- **Item transport**: Golems can transport items from Copper Chests to other chests (see [Chest Compatibility](CHEST_COMPATIBILITY.md))
- **Button pressing**: Golems randomly press copper buttons with configurable chance (default 5%), acting as natural randomizers
- **Player-oriented spawning**: Golems and their chests face toward you when spawned

### Copper Chest
- **Four oxidation levels**: Copper chests age naturally alongside your golem
- **Double chest support**: Combine two copper chests for double storage
- **Copper-specific sounds**: Each oxidation level has unique opening and closing sounds
- **Waxing support**: Preserve your chest's oxidation level with honeycomb

### Copper Buttons
- **8 variants**: (4 oxidation stages + waxed versions) with 1.5s activation time
- **Button Interactions**: Scrape with axe, wax with honeycomb, oxidized buttons won't work (unless waxed)
- **Golem Button AI**: Golems now intelligently search for and press nearby copper buttons

### Copper Statue
- **Four poses**: Standing, running, sitting, and star pose
- **Interactive**: Right-click with an empty hand to cycle through poses
- **Restoration**: Use an axe to bring oxidized statues back to life as golems
- **Custom sounds**: Unique audio for placing, breaking, and interacting

### Shelves
- **12 wood variants**: Oak, Spruce, Birch, Jungle, Acacia, Dark Oak, Mangrove, Cherry, Bamboo, Crimson, Warped, and Pale Oak (with VanillaBackport)
- **Item display**: Place up to 4 items on each shelf
- **Redstone output**: Shelves emit a redstone signal based on stored items
- **Connected textures**: Shelves connect visually when placed side by side

### Copper Tools & Weapons
- **Full tool set**: Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel, Hoe, and Sword
- **Balanced stats**: Between stone and iron tier
- **Unique sounds**: Custom equip sounds for copper equipment

### Copper Armor
- **Full armor set**: Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, and Boots
- **Custom sounds**: Unique equip sounds for copper armor
- **Balanced protection**: Between chainmail and iron tier

### Audio Design
- **50+ custom sounds**: Complete sound system for entities, blocks, and interactions
- **Oxidation-specific audio**: Different sounds for each weathering stage
- **Item interaction feedback**: Audio cues when golems pick up, drop, or interact with items

### Configurable
- **Enable/disable**: Golem button pressing in config file

### VanillaBackport Support
